 Opgave uge 2 af Specialisterne Academy


### Opgave 1:

Running `nameData.py` should print the first 10 names of the list of names, sorted first
by alphabetical order, then by length of the names.  
It then prints the dictionary of letter counts. Currently it is set to ignore letter case, but this can be changed by setting `case_difference` to `True` when calling `dict_letters()`.


### Opgave 2:

Run `logfile_analyzer.py` to analyze the data stored in `app_log.txt`.  
This will create a new file for each of the log types (SUCCESS, ERROR, WARNING, & INFO). Should other log types be relevant to the logfile, update the variable `log_types` as needed. Should another logfile be relevant, update the call to `open_logfile` with the relevant path.
